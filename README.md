# Keylogger
A keylogger or keystroke logger/keyboard capturing is a form of malware or hardware that keeps track of and records your keystrokes as you type. It takes the information and sends it to a hacker using a command-and-control server. The hacker then analyzes the keystrokes to locate usernames and passwords and uses them to hack into otherwise secure systems.
This is a simple keylogger project, which generates a text file once input is provided from the keyboard and stores all values.
